Expanding on our support for external automation providers, we are excited to announce support for HCP Terraform (https://app.terraform.io/app) and Terraform Enterprise in the upcoming Spassky release.

Our capabilities as of this release include:
* Collection of Terraform Workspaces across multiple Orgs and Projects
* Collection Runs for these Workspaces
* Service Catalog support allowing end users to order a Workflow Plan via the Catalog.

The addition of HCP Terraform complements the existing Embedded Terraform automation giving users more options for how they want to automate their infrastructure.

For more information on using HCP Terraform with ManageIQ check out the documentation at https://www.manageiq.org/docs/reference/latest/managing_providers/index.html#terraform-enterprise
