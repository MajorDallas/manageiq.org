Few days ago one of our fellows, Christian Jung, published a very good article explaining best practices while coding Ruby code inside Red Hat CloudForms.
The post does not claim to be exhaustive, but establishes guidelines about coding, naming conventions and rules to follow in order to make the code cleaner, easier to understand, and more consumable by others.
  
In the article, several key topics are discussed, such as:

* Naming Convention
* Automate Domains
* Git Integration
* Unit Testing
* Code Documentation with RDoc
  
Anyone who works with Automate in CloudForms should review [Christian’s article] (<https://www.jung-christian.de/post/2017/10/automate-best-practice/>).
Additional documentation on Automation in Red Hat CloudForms can be found on the [product documentation] (<https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/>) as well as on the comprehensive book from Peter McGowan on Mastering Automation in CloudForms.
