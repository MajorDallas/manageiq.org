With this short video, we continue our series based on Red Hat Knowledge Base articles exploring how to take advantage of Ansible Automation inside Red Hat CloudForms. This post is a follow-up of our previous My First Ansible Service article.

As a summary, what we do in this video is to create a control policy that checks if the VM CPU or memory size has changed, and if so, resets the size to 1 CPU and 1GB automatically.

Specifically, what we show in this video is how to:

* Create VMware credentials for vCenter
* Create a new Service Item to reconfigure our VM
* Create a new Action and Policy for running an Ansible Playbook
* Create and assign a new Policy Profile to VMs
* Test the Policy by re-configuring VM resources manually, and validating our control Policy

The Red Hat Knowledge Base article, including the necessary playbooks to implement this example, are available on this [Red Hat Knowledge Base] (<https://access.redhat.com/articles/3062981>) article.

Please note that you need to install pysphere from the appliance console for the playbook to run:

easy_install -U pysphere
