## Upgrade Notes

Due to the vaulting of CentOS Stream 8<sup>[[1]][[2]]</sup>, the existing RPM repo files are pointing to a mirrorlist that no longer exists. As such, when doing an RPM upgrade to quinteros-2, there are some manual steps that need to be done first. Run the following 2 commands before upgrading, which will point the CentOS repo files to the new vault location.

```bash
sed -i 's/mirrorlist=/#mirrorlist=/g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*.repo
sed -i 's/#baseurl=http:\/\/mirror/baseurl=http:\/\/vault/g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*.repo
```

Note that for the upcoming Radjabov release we will be upgrading to CentOS Stream 9, so these changes are a one-time step for upgrading to Quinteros-2.
