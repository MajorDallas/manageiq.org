For the last few posts Laurent Domb has been explaining how to squeeze CloudForms and AWS integration by teaching you how to:

* Upload the CF images to AWS
* Create all the needed config files in AWS
* Deploy CF on AWS
* Configure the new in 4.6 SmartState Analysis (SSA)
* Use that SSA to add a compliance policy to an instance
* Use AWS authentication in CF
  
You can find the blog posts here:
