Whether you operate a single standalone CloudForms appliance or multiple multizone regions geographically dispersed with a global master region, effective management makes all the difference.  

In this video, I highlight some new tools for managing appliances and reviewing log files in any CloudForms environment. In particular, miqgrep is incredibly helpful for reviewing CloudForms logs across multiple appliances and provides the ability to follow requests and associated tasks through the logs, quickly bringing all the related log entries to one central location while eliminating unrelated noise.

These new tools have been recently merged into ManageIQ, and will be incorporated into both the 4.5 and 4.6 releases of Red Hat Cloudforms. For additional resources on configuring and using these tools, please see the links below:
