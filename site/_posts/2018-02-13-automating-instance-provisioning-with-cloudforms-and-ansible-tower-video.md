This video demonstrates how you can take manual tasks and processes and turn them into automation workflows. In this video we utilize Red Hat CloudForms and Ansible Tower to provide an underlying automation and orchestration framework to deliver automation to your IT organization.

The demonstration shows how a user can order a service and have automation provision and deliver the resources while tracking the elements in a ticketing system (ServiceNow).

At a high level, the following areas are demonstrated:

* Ordering an instance inside CloudForms self-service portal
* CloudForms auto approval and quota escalation features
* Ansible Towerâ€™s powerful and intuitive workflows
* Integration into third party web services (ServiceNow and Microsoft Azure)
